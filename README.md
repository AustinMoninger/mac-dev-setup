# My Mac Dev Environment Setup

I try to stay as digitally minimalistic as possible, only downloading exactly what I use and need and getting rid of everything else. I also make sure that at any given time if I lose my device or it is stolen, that there isn't a single item on them that I would lose (other than the physical device itself, of course). 

That was in part the motivation for this repo; I already have all the files I do not want to lose stored in the cloud, but I did not have anyway to remember how I like my machine configured. The other part of the motivation was that over the beginning of my internship I received a computer that was a clean slate, and instead of being able to configure it how I liked all at once, I had to slowly recall all the settings I liked over the course of the summer. Now with this page, I can be done with all of that on the first day in a few (several) clicks. I borrowed a lot from [this repository](https://github.com/nicolashery/mac-dev-setup); check it out too.

</a>

[Install Consolas Font Family](http://www.fontpalace.com/font-download/Consolas/)

Code looks nice in `this font`. It comes installed with Microsoft Office but otherwise you have to download it.

Are there really any other options?

[Install Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/): ([must install Homebrew first](https://github.com/AustinMoninger/my-mac-dev-setup#homebrew))

    $ brew cask install google-chrome

#### Google Chrome Extensions
* [Just Read](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/just-read/dgmanlpmmkibanfdgjocnabmcaclkmod?hl=en). Strips webpages down to purely the text so you can actually focus and read the material contained within them. Next step is to find an extension that strips away hypertext links too (let me know if you find one).

* [Grammarly](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/grammarly-for-chrome/kbfnbcaeplbcioakkpcpgfkobkghlhen). Checks your grammar and spelling for you in most places within Chrome. Doesn't work in Google Docs for some reason (I typically just paste my text into [wordcounter.net](https://wordcounter.net/) to have Grammarly check it real quick). Premium version has some extra bells and whistles that I don't pay for.

* [Empty New Tab Page](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/empty-new-tab-page/dpjamkmjmigaoobjbekmfgabipmfilij). Beautiful, blank new tab page that doesn't have the distraction ridden thumbnails that the default new tab page does.

* [Adblock Plus](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/adblock-plus/cfhdojbkjhnklbpkdaibdccddilifddb?hl=en-US). Self-explanatory (assuming that you are okay with not supporting websites via ads).

* [DF YouTube](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/df-youtube-distraction-fr/mjdepdfccjgcndkmemponafgioodelna). Stands for Distraction Free YouTube. Configurable to hide comments and/or related videos. Perfect for when I am trying to use YouTube for school/work and don't want to go down a rabbit hole of watching related content.


### Visual Studio Code
<a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=534106">

## Developer Configurations

### Homebrew
<a href="https://brew.sh/">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28496268/43357867-a461e306-924d-11e8-9cb0-633d79c7bded.png" width="9%" height="9%">

Package managers make it easier to install and update applications (for Operating Systems) or libraries (for programming languages). The most popular one for OS X is [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

Homebrew needs Command Line Tools for Xcode.

    $ xcode-select --install
    
Install Homebrew.

    $ ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
    
Helpful commands:

    $ brew update             # update Homebrew's directory
    $ brew outdated           # see if any packages need to be updated
    $ brew upgrade <package>  # update a package
    $ brew upgrade            # update all outdated packages
    $ brew cleanup            # remove older versions of installed packages
    $ brew list --versions    # see what you have installed and their versions
    
    
### Pretty Terminal
<a href="https://github.com/AustinMoninger/my-mac-dev-setup/blob/master/.bash_profile">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28496268/42415621-6dbdf21a-821a-11e8-86e4-3331f86ba1b5.png" width="8%" height="19%">
</a>

To make the text in terminal look a little more appealing, follow these commands to overwrite your current Unix user's profile. I shamelessly got these files from [this repository](https://github.com/nicolashery/mac-dev-setup) because it looks really nice.

    $ cd ~
    $ curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AustinMoninger/my-mac-dev-setup/master/.bash_profile
    $ curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AustinMoninger/my-mac-dev-setup/master/.bash_prompt
    $ curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AustinMoninger/my-mac-dev-setup/master/.aliases

Note: `ls -lh` can now be run with `ll` and `ls -lha` can now be run with `la`.


### Git
<a href="https://git-scm.com/">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28496268/43357868-a5ecebc6-924d-11e8-815d-301ec301f13e.png" width="8%" height="8%">
</a>

Hard to get very far in software development without this one. Add the [.gitconfig](https://github.com/AustinMoninger/my-mac-dev-setup/blob/master/.gitconfig) file to add some colors to the `status`, `diff`, and `branch` commands.

    $ brew install git
    $ cd ~
    $ curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AustinMoninger/my-mac-dev-setup/master/.gitconfig
    
Then define your Git user:

    $ git config --global user.name "Name"
    $ git config --global user.email "email@email.com"
    
And then add this so that you do not have to type your username and password each time you push via HTTPS:

    $ git config --global credential.helper osxkeychain


### Vim
<a href="https://www.vim.org/">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28496268/43357869-a6d89cb0-924d-11e8-9cae-8f00ec74ec7e.png" width="8%" height="8%">
</a>

Vim is already installed and I only really use Vim when I must. But since it doesn't look all that pretty and [Tim Pope](https://github.com/tpope) has put together some nice defaults already, I might as well use them.

Install [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) with:

    $ mkdir -p ~/.vim/autoload ~/.vim/bundle
    $ curl -LSso ~/.vim/autoload/pathogen.vim https://tpo.pe/pathogen.vim
    
Then create a file `~/.vimrc` and paste the following in it:

    execute pathogen#infect()
    syntax on
    filetype plugin indent on
    
Finally, install the Vim "sensible defaults" with:

    $ cd ~/.vim/bundle
    $ git clone git://github.com/tpope/vim-sensible.git
    

### Python
<a href="https://www.python.org/">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28496268/43358253-1b5585de-9254-11e8-8073-f9e12c2ab26b.png" width="8%" height="8%">
</a>

OS X comes with [Python](https://www.python.org/) already installed but using Homebrew makes it easier to keep your installation up to date. 

This will install Python 2.7 and any required dependencies:

    $ brew install python

Pip is the package manager for Python and Distribute is its dependency. Upgrade them both:

    $ pip install --upgrade distribute
    $ pip install --upgrade pip
    
Executable scripts from Python packages you install will be put in `/usr/local/share/python`, so let's add it to `$PATH`. Create `.path`in `~`, `.bash_profile` is already set to call this.

    $ cd ~
    $ vi .path
 
Add these lines:

    PATH=/usr/local/share/python:$PATH
    export PATH
    
#### Pip
    
Helpful Pip commands:
  
    $ pip install <package>            # install a package
    $ pip install --upgrade <package>  # upgrade a package
    $ pip freeze                       # see what is installed
    $ pip uninstall <package>          # uninstall a package
    
#### Virtualenv

Install Virtualenv so that you can install packages required for a certain project in an isolated folder within the project that will be managed by virtualenv. That way if different project require different versions of packages you do not have to deal with changing the global package version (and keep your global installations fairly clean).

    $ pip install virtualenv
    
Helpful commands:

    $ virtualenv venv --distribute                          # setup virtualenv in this directory
    $ virtualenv venv --distribute --system-site-packages   # inherit globally installed packages
    $ source venv/bin/activate                              # activate (venv)
    $ pip install <package>                                 # when (venv) is active, installs package in venv folder
    
#### NumPy

Lots of mathematical functions:

    $ pip install numpy
    
#### Matplotlib

2D plotting library:

    $ pip install matplotlib
    
    
### Java
<a href="https://java.com/en/download/">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28496268/43370003-0c3db0aa-933d-11e8-9c8d-b1c1ee7776ac.png" width="7%" height="7%">
</a>

Another essential.

    $ brew cask install java

I probably trust this company too much.
* [Spotify](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/spotify-music/id324684580?mt=8). Ol' faithful.
