# My Mac Dev Environment Setup

Once upon a time, I got a laptop for work. And it had none of the settings/installations/configurations that I wanted/needed/craved. **NEVER AGAIN.** 

This is so I never have to remember anything and can use this on every future work/personal Mac I get. And for anyone else who wants to use it. Lots of credit to [this repository](https://github.com/nicolashery/mac-dev-setup) from which I borrowed a good chunk of this setup.


## Manual Downloads

### Chrome

Are there really any other options?
[Install Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)

#### Chrome Extensions
* [Just Read](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/just-read/dgmanlpmmkibanfdgjocnabmcaclkmod?hl=en). Strips webpages down to purely the text so you can actually focus and read the material contained within them. Next step is to find an extension that strips away hypertext links too (let me know if you find one).

* [Grammarly](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/grammarly-for-chrome/kbfnbcaeplbcioakkpcpgfkobkghlhen). Checks your grammar and spelling for you in most places within Chrome. Doesn't work in Google Docs for some reason (I typically just paste my text into [wordcounter.net](https://wordcounter.net/) to have Grammarly check it real quick). Premium version has some extra bells and whistles that I don't pay for.

* [Empty New Tab Page](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/empty-new-tab-page/dpjamkmjmigaoobjbekmfgabipmfilij). Beautiful, blank new tab page that doesn't have the distraction ridden thumbnails that the default new tab page does.

* [Adblock Plus](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/adblock-plus/cfhdojbkjhnklbpkdaibdccddilifddb?hl=en-US). Self-explanatory.

* [DF YouTube](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/df-youtube-distraction-fr/mjdepdfccjgcndkmemponafgioodelna). Stands for Distraction Free YouTube. Configurable to hide comments and/or related videos. Perfect for when I am trying to use YouTube for school/work and don't want to go down a rabbit hole of watching related content.


### VSCode

I just got into using this over Atom. I'll add extensions/plugins here when I find some that I like.
