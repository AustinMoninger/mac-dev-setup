# My Mac Dev Environment Setup

I try to stay as "digitally minimalistic" as possible, only downloading exactly what I use and need and getting rid of everything else. I also make sure that at any given time if I lose my device or it is stolen, that there isn't a single item on them that I would lose (other than the physical device itself, of course). That was in part the motivation for this repo; I already have all the files I do not want to lose stored in the cloud, but I did not have anyway to remember how I like my machine configured. The other part of the motivation was that over the course of my internship, I had to slowly recall all the settings that I liked on my machine (for my work machine, that is). Now with this page I can be done with all of that on the first day in a few (several) clicks. I borrowed a lot from [this repository](https://github.com/nicolashery/mac-dev-setup); check that out too if you are interested.


## Manual Downloads

### Google Chrome 
<a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/">

</a>

[Install Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)

Are there really any other options?

#### Google Chrome Extensions
* [Just Read](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/just-read/dgmanlpmmkibanfdgjocnabmcaclkmod?hl=en). Strips webpages down to purely the text so you can actually focus and read the material contained within them. Next step is to find an extension that strips away hypertext links too (let me know if you find one).

* [Grammarly](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/grammarly-for-chrome/kbfnbcaeplbcioakkpcpgfkobkghlhen). Checks your grammar and spelling for you in most places within Chrome. Doesn't work in Google Docs for some reason (I typically just paste my text into [wordcounter.net](https://wordcounter.net/) to have Grammarly check it real quick). Premium version has some extra bells and whistles that I don't pay for.

* [Empty New Tab Page](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/empty-new-tab-page/dpjamkmjmigaoobjbekmfgabipmfilij). Beautiful, blank new tab page that doesn't have the distraction ridden thumbnails that the default new tab page does.

* [Adblock Plus](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/adblock-plus/cfhdojbkjhnklbpkdaibdccddilifddb?hl=en-US). Self-explanatory (assuming that you are okay with not supporting websites via ads).

* [DF YouTube](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/df-youtube-distraction-fr/mjdepdfccjgcndkmemponafgioodelna). Stands for Distraction Free YouTube. Configurable to hide comments and/or related videos. Perfect for when I am trying to use YouTube for school/work and don't want to go down a rabbit hole of watching related content.


### Visual Studio Code
