# mac-dev-setup

## Once upon a time, I got a laptop for work.
And it had none of the settings/installations/configurations that I wanted/needed/craved. **NEVER AGAIN.** This is for me and every future work/personal Mac I get. And for anyone else who wants to use it. Lots of credit to this repository where I borrowed a lot of this from: https://github.com/nicolashery/mac-dev-setup.
