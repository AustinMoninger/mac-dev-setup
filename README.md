# My Mac Dev Environment Setup

Once upon a time, I got a laptop for work. And it had none of the settings/installations/configurations that I wanted/needed/craved. **NEVER AGAIN.** 

This is for me and every future work/personal Mac I get. And for anyone else who wants to use it. Lots of credit to [this repository](https://github.com/nicolashery/mac-dev-setup) from which I borrowed a good chunk of this setup.


## Manual Downloads

### Chrome
Are there really any other options?
[Install Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)

#### Chrome Extensions
* [Just Read](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/just-read/dgmanlpmmkibanfdgjocnabmcaclkmod?hl=en). Strips webpages down to purely the text so you can actually focus and read the material contained within them. Next is to find an extension that strips away hypertext links too (let me know if you find one).

* [Grammarly](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/grammarly-for-chrome/kbfnbcaeplbcioakkpcpgfkobkghlhen). Checks your grammar and spelling for you in most places within Chrome. Doesn't work in Google Docs for some reason (I typically just paste my text into [wordcounter.net](wordcounter.net) to have Grammarly check it real quick). Premium version has some extra bells and whistles that I don't pay for.
